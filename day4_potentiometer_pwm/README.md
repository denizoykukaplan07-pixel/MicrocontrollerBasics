# Day 4 – Potentiometer to PWM Control

## Objective
Use an analog input to control LED brightness in real time.

## Concepts Learned
- analogRead()
- ADC resolution (0–1023)
- Mapping analog values to PWM output
- Sensor → actuator control

## Description
A potentiometer is used as a voltage divider and connected to an analog input pin.  
The measured value is mapped to a PWM output to control LED brightness.

This is a fundamental example of analog signal processing in embedded systems.
