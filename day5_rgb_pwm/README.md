# Day 5 – RGB LED Control using PWM

## Objective
Control an RGB LED using three independent PWM channels to generate smooth color transitions.

## Concepts Learned
- Multi-channel PWM control
- RGB color mixing
- Independent duty cycle adjustment
- Embedded system actuator coordination

## Description
An RGB LED is controlled by three PWM-enabled pins corresponding to the red, green,
and blue channels. By varying the duty cycle of each channel, different colors and
smooth transitions are produced.

This technique is commonly used in embedded systems as a visual status indicator.
