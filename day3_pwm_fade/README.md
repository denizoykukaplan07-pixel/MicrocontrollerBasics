# Day 3 – PWM LED Fade

## Objective
Control LED brightness smoothly using PWM.

## Concepts Learned
- Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
- analogWrite()
- Duty cycle (0–255)
- Loop-based animation logic

## Description
The LED brightness is gradually increased and decreased by modifying the PWM duty cycle.  
This demonstrates how analog-like behavior can be achieved using digital outputs.
