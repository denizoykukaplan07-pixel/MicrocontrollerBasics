# Day 1 – Blink (Digital Output Basics)

## Objective
Learn the basics of digital output control by blinking an LED at a fixed interval.

## Concepts Learned
- pinMode()
- digitalWrite()
- delay()
- Timing control in microcontrollers

## Description
The built-in LED is configured as an output and toggled ON and OFF with a fixed delay.  
This project serves as the foundation for understanding how microcontrollers control hardware pins.
